            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm a generalist software engineer, which means I'm mediocre at a lot of things at once :) I
                graduated from UCLA in 2023, and have been working at Tesla since then.

            <p>I'm interested in stuff like:
            <ul>
                <li>Robotics control, path planning, and vision algorithms.</li>
                <li>Embedded software -- interactive art exhibits, home automation, IoT gadgets, etc.</li>
                <li>Low-level software -- device drivers, high-performance compute,<br>latency and throughput
                    optimization through knowledge of the underlying hardware.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>More generally, I enjoy working on projects involving software, electrical, and mechanical design.
                I'm a big fan of
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtHaxi4GTYDpJgMSGy7AeSw">Michael Reeves</a>
                and
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj1VqrHhDte54oLgPG4xpuQ">Stuff Made Here</a>
                on YouTube. I aspire to someday be on Shane's level of programming, CAD, and fabrication mastery :)
            </p>

                    <li>
                        Wrote device drivers and middleware for various automated test equipment (ATE) used in the
                        avionics testing process.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Homebridge is a platform for connecting third-party devices to Apple's HomeKit home automation
                        framework.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Apple defines certain "device classes" that your IoT gadgets can appear as — switches,
                        humidifiers, sensors, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/tkanarsky/homebridge-alarm-listener">Homebridge plugin</a>
                        that appears as a "smoke sensor" accessory. It uses the host computer's microphone to listen for
                        smoke alarms going off in the area, and if it hears an alarm going off it triggers the virtual
                        smoke sensor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the user has HomeKit Remote Access enabled, they'll be notified of their smoke alarm going
                        off even if they're away from home.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They can also use the sensor value in automation scripts. For example, one can turn on the
                        lights throughout the house if an alarm goes off.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                </summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We designed, built, and tested an autonomous submersible, and competed in the annual RoboSub
                        competition in San Diego.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wrote <a href="https://github.com/tkanarsky/dvl-test/">a driver</a>
                        to interface a new velocity sensor with the sub's ATMega microcontroller over a serial link. It
                        helped us navigate underwater much more precisely than before.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created a web-based admin panel that allowed us to arm or disarm the sub, view feeds from
                        cameras, monitor the internal state of the sub's software, and manually control the thrusters
                        over a websocket. Saved a bunch time when debugging vision algorithms, as we could see exactly
                        what the sub was seeing in real time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prototyped a series of object detection algorithms to recognize underwater obstacles such as
                        colored buoys, floating gates, and plastic bins on the seafloor. I used the OpenCV library to
                        develop routines that color-corrected the images, detected edges and other characteristic
                        features, and clustered them into object bounding boxes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
