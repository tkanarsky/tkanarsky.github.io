            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm a third-year computer science major at UCLA. I'm probably going to minor in math as well.</p>
            <p>I like writing code that interacts with the world in real time. I'm interested in stuff like:
                <ul>
                    <li>Robotics control, path planning, and vision algorithms.</li>
                    <li>Embedded software -- interactive art exhibits, home automation, IoT gadgets, etc.</li>
                    <li>Low-level software -- device drivers, high-performance compute,<br>latency and throughput optimization through knowledge of the underlying hardware.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>More generally, I enjoy working on projects involving software, electrical, and mechanical design.
                I'm a big fan of
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtHaxi4GTYDpJgMSGy7AeSw">Michael Reeves</a> 
                and 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj1VqrHhDte54oLgPG4xpuQ">Stuff Made Here</a> 
                on YouTube. I aspire to someday be on Shane's level of programming, CAD, and fabrication mastery :)
            </p>

                    Avionics intern at <a href="https://spacex.com">SpaceX</a>, summer 2020
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Wrote device drivers and middleware for various automated test equipment (ATE) used in the avionics testing process.

                        <li>
                            Later helped optimize a telemetry validator algorithm using vectorized code and parallelism

                        <li>
                            Created a software framework for a new type of test procedure, combining ATE control, data validation, and technician-friendly anomaly reporting.

                    Part of the
                    <a href="https://avbotz.com">Amador Valley Robotics</a> software team from 2016 to 2019
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We designed, built, and tested an autonomous submersible, and competed in the annual RoboSub competition in San Diego.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Wrote <a href="https://github.com/tkanarsky/dvl-test/">a driver</a> 
                            to interface a new velocity sensor with the sub's ATMega microcontroller over a serial link. It helped us navigate underwater much more precisely than before.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Created a web-based admin panel that allowed us to arm or disarm the sub, view feeds from cameras, monitor the internal state of the sub's software, and manually control the thrusters over a websocket. Saved a bunch time when debugging vision algorithms, as we could see exactly what the sub was seeing in real time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Prototyped a series of object detection algorithms to recognize underwater obstacles such as colored buoys, floating gates, and plastic bins on the seafloor. I used the OpenCV library to develop routines that color-corrected the images, detected edges and other characteristic features, and clustered them into object bounding boxes.

                    <li>
                        Homebridge is a platform for connecting third-party devices to Apple's HomeKit home automation framework. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Apple defines certain "device classes" that your IoT gadgets can appear as — switches, humidifiers, sensors, etc. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/tkanarsky/homebridge-alarm-listener">Homebridge plugin</a> that appears as a "smoke sensor" accessory. It uses the host computer's microphone to listen for smoke alarms going off in the area, and if it hears an alarm going off it triggers the virtual smoke sensor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the user has HomeKit Remote Access enabled, they'll be notified of their smoke alarm going off even if they're away from home. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They can also use the sensor value in automation scripts. For example, one can turn on the lights throughout the house if an alarm goes off.
                    </li>
