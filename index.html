            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm a generalist software engineer, which means I'm mediocre at a lot of things at once :) I
                graduated from UCLA in 2023, and have been working at Tesla since then.

            <p>I'm interested in stuff like:
            <ul>
                <li>Robotics control, path planning, and vision algorithms.</li>
                <li>Embedded software -- interactive art exhibits, home automation, IoT gadgets, etc.</li>
                <li>Low-level software -- device drivers, high-performance compute,<br>latency and throughput
                    optimization through knowledge of the underlying hardware.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>More generally, I enjoy working on projects involving software, electrical, and mechanical design.
                I'm a big fan of
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtHaxi4GTYDpJgMSGy7AeSw">Michael Reeves</a>
                and
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj1VqrHhDte54oLgPG4xpuQ">Stuff Made Here</a>
                on YouTube. I aspire to someday be on Shane's level of programming, CAD, and fabrication mastery :)

                <li><a href="https://www.cbaguilar.com">Christian Aguilar</a>, a fellow appreciator of the invisible
                    infrastructure of the world, hiking, and beer. We studied together at UCLA and would hang out a lot after class, bonding over shared childhood experiences (ham radio, Boy Scouts, making DIY automatic sprinklers...)</li>
                <li><a href="https://simonsafar.com">Simon Safar</a>, one of my coworkers at Tesla and modern
                    philosopher who has already thought every single thought I have thought to be original.</li>
                <li><a href="https://cobular.com">Julie Cover</a>, one of my former Makerspace coworkers who is
                    particularly good at making computers work.</li>

                <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37976541-bad-blood">Bad Blood</a> - about Elizabeth Holmes' Theranos saga. It's crazy how she got away with it for so long.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6665847-daemon">Daemon</a> - a pretty realistic take on how a rogue non-human agent could take over the world and participate in the human economy, undetected, until it's too late.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77773.To_Say_Nothing_of_the_Dog">To Say Nothing of the Dog</a> - cozy novel about time travel to Victorian England and the hijinks that ensue.</li>

            <h2>Do things with me!</h2>
            <p>
                I have a <abbr title="written permission from the government to wiggle a section of aether (not too hard, and not for profit)">ham radio license</abbr> - my call sign is KK6EKQ. I haven't upgraded to general class yet (I've been meaning to do that.) I don't monitor VHF/UHF very often but let me know if you're on the air in the Bay Area -- let's QSL!
            </p>
            <p>
                I like <abbr title="An outdoor activity where people hide small boxes with logbooks in them and post the coordinates online for people to find">geocaching</abbr> a lot. It's a good excuse to go outdoors and look incredibly suspicious while playing the IRL equivalent of a point and click mystery game. If you like it too, let's go caching on the weekend! 
            </p>
            <p>I walk the Stanford dish trail pretty often. It's by the office and the views are nice. Let me know if you have similar plans!</p>
            <p>I absolutely adore <abbr title="Long dogs with stubby legs and pointy ears and short tail.">corgis</abbr>. If you have a corgi, and it likes to be pet, I want to pet it. The same goes with <abbr title="Like a huge herbivorous dog with hooves and a long face.">horses</abbr>. I read online that a horse's nose is surprisingly soft. I want to pet a horse and feed it carrots but I don't know anyone with a horse. If you happen to be reading this and have a horse I could pet, I would love to do so.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Homebridge is a platform for connecting third-party devices to Apple's HomeKit home automation
                        framework.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Apple defines certain "device classes" that your IoT gadgets can appear as — switches,
                        humidifiers, sensors, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/tkanarsky/homebridge-alarm-listener">Homebridge plugin</a>
                        that appears as a "smoke sensor" accessory. It uses the host computer's microphone to listen for
                        smoke alarms going off in the area, and if it hears an alarm going off it triggers the virtual
                        smoke sensor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the user has HomeKit Remote Access enabled, they'll be notified of their smoke alarm going
                        off even if they're away from home.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They can also use the sensor value in automation scripts. For example, one can turn on the
                        lights throughout the house if an alarm goes off.
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We designed, built, and tested an autonomous submersible, and competed in the annual RoboSub
                        competition in San Diego.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wrote <a href="https://github.com/tkanarsky/dvl-test/">a driver</a>
                        to interface a new velocity sensor with the sub's ATMega microcontroller over a serial link. It
                        helped us navigate underwater much more precisely than before.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created a web-based admin panel that allowed us to arm or disarm the sub, view feeds from
                        cameras, monitor the internal state of the sub's software, and manually control the thrusters
                        over a websocket. Saved a bunch time when debugging vision algorithms, as we could see exactly
                        what the sub was seeing in real time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prototyped a series of object detection algorithms to recognize underwater obstacles such as
                        colored buoys, floating gates, and plastic bins on the seafloor. I used the OpenCV library to
                        develop routines that color-corrected the images, detected edges and other characteristic
                        features, and clustered them into object bounding boxes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
